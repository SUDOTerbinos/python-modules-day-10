What is a Module in Python?

A module in Python is a file containing Python code, such as functions, classes, or variables, that you can use in your programs. Modules allow you to organize your code into smaller, reusable components.

Types of Modules

Built-in Modules: Pre-installed with Python (e.g., math, os, random).
Custom Modules: Created by you or others to organize code.
Third-Party Modules: Downloaded from libraries like PyPI (e.g., requests, numpy).
